what's the character distance between spanish, catalan and french

# Motivation
As a spanish speaker, being in Barcelona is not an issue... unless you dare to go to La Filmoteca de Catalunya and watch a French movie subtitled in Catalan.  
Given that I don't know any of both languages beyond a small set of words (not even half A1), I wondered how should I watch the movie if I wanted to grasp the meaning of dialogs.  
Should I focus on the speech sounds or the subtitles? Does it make any difference?  
My intuition says that Catalan should be easier to understand -at least that's what I think when I read it-. However, it resembles French when I hear it.  

# Research question
*Would you rather watch a Catalan movie at the la Cinémathèque française subtitled in French or a French movie at La Filmoteca de Catalunya subtitled in Catalan?*  
  
This repository explores the (dis)similarity betweeen three languages, Spanish, French, Catalan, measuring Levenshtein Distance considering the ortographic and phonemic transcriptions.
